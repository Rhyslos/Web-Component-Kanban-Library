Trello board: https://trello.com/b/DQRwWe85/kanban-library

In this assignment i will make a develop a kanban board library utilizing Natice Web Components.
The goal is to have a standalone widget that can be embeded into any web page, with "drag and drop" functionality focused on project management.
This library will store data with a PostreSQL database, and fetched via an API.
Data will be handled by a self built parsing algorithm to transfer the SQL relational data to the DOM structure for the visual board.
To satisfy the PWA requirement i will utilize local storage.

Goal of the project is to learn to setup such a library without relying on React for the visuals.
